# Dynamic Array of Strings in C++

This C++ program demonstrates how to manage a dynamic array of strings using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

## Overview

This program allows the user to input a specified number of strings,

allocates memory dynamically to store these strings, and then prints them out. 
 
It utilizes malloc for memory allocation and basic input/output operations for user interaction.


## Requirements

1- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)

2- Standard input/output library (iostream)


## Usage 

1- Compile the program

Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as g++:

	g++ main.cpp -o app.exe

2- Run the Program:

Execute the compiled program:

	./app.exe
	
3- Follow the Prompts:

	a- Enter the number of strings you want to input.
	
	b- Input each string one by one when prompted.
	
4- Output

	The program will display the strings you entered.
	

5- Example 

Suppose you want to input 3 strings:

	Please Enter the number of strings that you want: 3
	
	Let's fill the array of string
	
	Please enter the string number: 1
	
	Hello
	
	Please enter the string number: 2
	Dynamic
	
	Please enter the string number: 3
	
	Array
	
The output will be:
	
	Hello
	
	Dynamic
	
	Array
