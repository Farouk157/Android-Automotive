# Question 2

Write a “calculator class” in a program which asks for two numbers and a mathematical operator 

(represented as a char type). 

Depending on the operator (+, -, *, /, ^, sqrt( ) ‘S’ ) call the appropriate function

and display the result.

Use a switch statement to filter the choices.


## The class should have private member functions for the operations

## and a public function which is the interface with the user.
