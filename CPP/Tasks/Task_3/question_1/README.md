# Q1: Vertex Structure

Write a program that defines a simple Vertex structure (a point on the x-

y plane) having two integer components for the x and y values.

Your program should generate 5 random vertices each having integer values

in the range of [-100,100], and write them to the terminal.

To generate a random number, use the rand() function â†’ <cstdlib>

## output 

each time will generate different values for the x and y 

here is a proof:

## each time we execute and apply this command [ ./app.exe ] it will generate different values
