# Question 2: Vertex Class

Write a program that replaces the Vertex structure used in the Q1 with a

C++ Vertex class having the following:

	- Two private member variables (x, y)
	
	- Member function that sets (x,y) with random numbers when invoked
	
	- Getters for (x, y)
	
	- Member function for return a string representation for the vertex.
	
Your main() routine should not be involved in generating random

numbers and string formatting.
