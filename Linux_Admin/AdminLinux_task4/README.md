### 5) State the difference between adduser and useradd with example shown.

a)-> useradd: A low-level command used to create a new user account, 
	      
	      cause it doesn't automatically create a home directory 
	      
	      or set up other default user settings unless specified.
	      
-> example:   

		sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash username
		
b)-> adduser: A high level command used to create a new user account, 

	      Automatically creates a home directory, sets default shell, 
	      
	      and prompts for additional user information

-> example: 

		sudo adduser username 

This command will prompt you to enter additional details such as the userâ€™s password, 

full name, and other information.
